### My Findings
I intercepted the network using tcpdump and I was able to find the authentication token in order to find the third flag. I was also able to see the specific sql queries being made to the database in plain text and I was able to see the resposnes to the queries. 

I documented the actual tcpdump inside the mitm/capture.pcap file and you are able to see all where I found the information.
